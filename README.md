# Competitive-Programming

## Template.cpp :
c++ codes for various functions


## C++14.sublime-build (FOR LINUX) : 

Build system to directly compile and run c++ programs in sublime on linux. Moreover it uses c++14 directly opposed to the fact that terminal doesnt.

***Instructions :***
* Go to Tools > Build Systems > New Build System
* Copy the code from C++14.sublime-build and paste it ther and save it by any name.
* Go to Tools > Build Systems ans select your new build system
* Create 2 files named inputf.in and outputf.in in same directory in which u have ur code.
* Write input in inputf.in, save and run the code in sublime and you will get output in outputf.in .

***Tips :***
* You can use CTRL + shift + B to directly compile run.
* You can use 3 pane setup to view code, input dile and output file at once (ALT + SHIFT + 3).

## C++14.sublime-build (FOR OS X(Mac Users) ) :
Test
Follow the same steps above just copy the sublime build file corresponding to OS X. You need to have gcc and gtimout installed to be able to run above build system.

To install gcc in OS X : 
```
brew install gcc
```
To install gtimout in OS X :
```
brew install coreutils
```
Remember you may have to change the version in g++-{version} in sublime build file according to gcc version installed by brew. At the time of writting this post it is 10 hence is written as g++-9

***This is how it looks***
